      <h3>Part 1 : Setting up your pfSense router<br>
      </h3>
      <div align="left"><br>
        I like to keep a small virtual lab on my laptop so I can play
        around with it when time permits. For this tutorial you will
        need:<br>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads">VirtualBox</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://pfsense.org/download/">pfSense iso</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://wiki.centos.org/Download">CentOS 7
              Everything iso</a><br>
          </li>
          <li><a
href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/metasploitable/files/Metasploitable2/">Metasploitable</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://www.kali.org/downloads/">Kali Linux ova</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Part 1 will be covering setting up pfSense to use as a router
          for your internal network.<br>
          <a href="virtualNetwork2.html">Part 2</a> will cover
          installing Kali and Metasploitable<br>
          Part 3 will cover provisioning a PXE Boot Server<br>
          Part 4 will cover setting up Snort and Wireshark to look at
          your new network<br>
        </p>
        <ul>
        </ul>
        Start by installing VirtualBox if you don't have it
        already.&nbsp; Click "New" to provision a new VM.&nbsp; Name it
        something sensible (like pfSense - router) that identifies
        it.&nbsp; The type is BSD and the version<br>
        pfSense is based on is FreeBSD (64-bit).&nbsp; It doesn't need
        much memory so give it only 256 MB.&nbsp; You can get away with
        a small .vdi as well so give it 1 GB and click "Create".<br>
        <br>
        Select the VM and click "Settings".&nbsp; Go to the Network
        settings.&nbsp; For Adapter 1, I changed it to use the Bridged
        Network (this makes some set up options easier, like the default
        gateway and DNS settings).&nbsp; Enable Adapter 2, and choose
        Internal Network (change the name if you want but I left it as
        the default "intnet").&nbsp; This is all the settings we need to
        change to click "OK" then head to the top menu and click
        "Start".<br>
        <br>
        Browse to you pfSense iso and select it.&nbsp; Let it autoboot
        until you reach this screen.<br>
        <div align="center"><img alt="Configuration Console Page"
            src="virtualLabImages/001.JPG" height="368" width="717"><br>
        </div>
        These defaults should work so scroll down to "Accept these
        Settings" and hit Enter.<br>
        We will use the Quick/Easy Install for this tutorial so hit
        Enter again.&nbsp; Then hit Enter again (This is a new virtual
        HDD so we don't care that it's going to erase all data).<br>
        <br>
        During installation, you can choose to install a custom
        kernel.&nbsp; While a pretty cool feature, it's not necessary
        for us, so hit Enter to select "Standard Kernel".&nbsp; When
        installation is finished it will let you know it needs to
        reboot, so hit Enter again (which seems to be the majority of
        the tutorial, trust me keep reading because the hard[er] stuff
        is coming).<br>
        <b><font color="#ff0000">Before it reboots </font></b><font
          color="#ff0000"><font color="#000000">you need to click the
            disk icon at the bottom of the VM's screen to unmount the
            .iso.&nbsp; If you forget to do this then click the red X
            and power off the VM, go to Settings -&gt; Storage -&gt;
            Right-click on the .iso and remove it.&nbsp; The OS is
            already installed on the virtual HDD but it is a higher
            priority in the boot order so it will try to reinstall
            pfSense if you do not do this.<br>
            <br>
            When you get to this screen you're ready to continue.<br>
          </font></font>

          <div align="left">As you can see the WAN interface got the IP
            address 192.168.1.41 from DHCP on my router.&nbsp; This
            interface is what will allow your virtual network to access
            the internet for things like updates.&nbsp; But the LAN has
            not been automatically set up, so enter option 2 to
            configure a static IP address of your virtual network's
            gateway.&nbsp; Then select the number for the LAN
            option.&nbsp; I used these options for my virtual network.<br>

        You can keep it running now and check out the menu if you
        want.&nbsp; I prefer to shut it down with option 5 and restart
        it headless.&nbsp; Then I'll start up a new VM with a web
        browser to finish configuration.&nbsp; So I'll make a CentOS 7
        VM and give it 768 MB and a 2 GB .vdi.<br>
        <br>
        When you have the VM up and running open up Firefox and browse
        to http://192.168.2.1 (or whatever you set your IPv4 address
        as).&nbsp; The username is <b>admin</b> and the password is <b>pfsense</b>
        by default.&nbsp; You will want to change the password after the
        set-up wizard.<br>

            src="virtualLabImages/003.JPG" height="291" width="732"><br>
        </div>
        Click Next to start the wizard and on the next page.&nbsp; The
        next screen is the General Settings, so here are my settings:<br>
        <table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" width="100%">
          <tbody>

            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
        The time server information was correct to I just kept the
        defaults.&nbsp; Similarly, WAN is already configured correctly,
        so we can skip the next page also.&nbsp; LAN is also correctly
        configured, but if you want to make any changes to it now would
        be the time.&nbsp; When done click Next.&nbsp; Set your new
        admin password and reload the configuration.<br>
        <br>
        So now you're in the dashboard and everything looks good
        right?&nbsp; But you open a new tab and go to google.com and get
        nothing.&nbsp; So what is the next step?&nbsp; DNS.&nbsp; It's
        almost always DNS.&nbsp; To confirm you can ping 8.8.8.8, but
        not google.com.&nbsp; Go to Services -&gt; DNS Resolver and
        unselect Enable DNS Resolver.&nbsp; Then go to Services -&gt;
        DNS Forwarder.&nbsp; You can check by running an nslookup on
        fw1.<br>
        <br>
        This is the end of part 1.&nbsp; Next part we will be getting
        Kali and Metasploitable set up on your virtual network.<br>
