        <br>
        For this project, we wanted to upgrade our Apple computing lab
        but we had some specific requirements from faculty, students,
        and our own IT standards.&nbsp; I only did this for one iMac
        that I was going to use as the base image.&nbsp; I will then use
        Clonezilla to clone the hard drive and restore it on the other
        iMacs.&nbsp; This exact hard drive copy method would prevent me
        from having to configure multiple computers, and would ensure
        that each computer was configured exactly like the others for
        the entire lab.&nbsp; Restoring hard drives ended up taking 10
        minutes per machine, making this solution the most cost
        effective method.<br>
        <br>
        <u>Requirements</u>:<br>
        <ul>
          <li>Local administrator access with a strong password<br>
          </li>
          <li>Any changes the user makes to the local system must be
            reset upon logging off</li>
          <li>Users must be able to run a VM of Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and/or
            16.04 LTS</li>
          <li>Users must log on with their account on our department's
            Active Directory</li>
          <li>The users must be able to access their remote filesystem
            directories</li>
        </ul>
        The first requirement was the easiest.&nbsp; This was done on
        initial setup.<br>
        <br>
        To restrict any local changes we used Faronics Deep Freeze for
        Mac.&nbsp; But in order to use this software we had to ensure
        that we purchased iMac's that did not have the new Fusion
        drives.&nbsp; The reason for this is due to an Apple feature
        known as Core Storage.&nbsp; In order for Deep Freeze for Mac to
        work correctly, Core Storage must be turned off.&nbsp;
        Unfortunately this is not possible for Fusion drives because
        they rely on Core Storage to work.&nbsp; This also requires that
        the drive not have File Vault enabled, as it too relies on Core
        Storage.&nbsp; To turn Core Storage off open the Terminal
        application and type<br>
        <code><br>
          diskutil cs list</code><br>
        <br>
        This will list the Volumes mounted on the Mac.&nbsp; If Core
        Storage is turned on the hard drive it will be listed.&nbsp;
        Under the entry for Revertible you can see if Core Storage is
        able to be turned off.&nbsp; If it says "Yes" or "Yes (unlock
        and decryption required)" then you can turn Core Storage off by
        typing in the Terminal<br>
        <br>
        <code>diskutil cs revert /<br>
          <br>
        </code>If your drive does not support disabling Core Storage
        then all hope is not lost but this tutorial will not be covering
        the rest of the required steps.&nbsp; This is why we were
        careful in selection of iMacs (we have already learned the hard
        way!)&nbsp; After this was finished I installed Deep Freeze for
        Mac.&nbsp; This program also allows for remote management using
        the Apple Remote Desktop application available from the App
        Store.&nbsp; We looked at the app and closed the App Store once
        we saw the price, but if your budget can allow for it then it
        can be very useful.&nbsp; Configuration of Deep Freeze is
        documented extremely clearly by Faronics, and so I will refer
        you <a

        for setting it up.<br>
