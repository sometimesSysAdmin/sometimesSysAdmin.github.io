        I have a very old computer and didn't want to waste what little
        computing power it offered.&nbsp; While searching for a project
        to use it for, I came across Zeroshell.&nbsp; This is a Linux
        based OS that can be used for various Network Administration
        tasks.&nbsp; I have always seen the 802.1X option on my router,
        and never payed it much attention.&nbsp; Realizing that I can
        use this old computer for WPA Enterprise encryption seemed like
        the perfect project for this computer that is long past its EOL.<br>
        <br>
        I used Rufus to create a bootable flash drive using the DD image
        option and the <a href="http://www.zeroshell.org/download/#">Zeroshell-3.1.0-USB.img.gz</a>
