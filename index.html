<!-- Main Content -->
<p> Thank you for visiting my website.  I built this website (hosted on GitHub)
in order to further my knowledge and to give out the knowledge that I have 
gained.  There are tutorials related to System Administration, C++ and Assembly
programs that I have written, and blog posts for stories, words of wisdom, and 
the things that just won't fit anywhere else.  If this website has helped you
and you feel so inclined, please click the donate button.  I don't do this for
the money but I always appreciate more coffee funds.  If you are an employer,
feel free to browse around.  There is a link to my current resume in "About me"
and I am always on the lookout for bigger and better opportunities.  Thank you
for reading and have a great day! </p>
