<!-- Main Content -->
<p> Thank you for visiting my website. There are tutorials related to System 
Administration in "Tutorials".  Under "Programs" I have C++ and Assembly
programs that I have written.  "Blog Posts" contains stories, words of wisdom, 
and the things that just won't fit anywhere else.</p>

<p> If this website has helped you, please click the donate button.  As a 
student and full-time father/husband, I always appreciate more coffee funds.  If you are an employer, there is a link to my current resume in "About me".  I am always on the lookout for bigger and better opportunities.  Thank you
for reading and have a great day! </p>
