    <h2> Career Objective </h2>
    <p>I am a Computer Science student at University of Nevada, Las
      Vegas expecting to graduate in Spring 2018. I also currently work
      as a Junior System Administrator in UNLV's Department of Computer
      Science. My goal is to get into DevOps or IT Management. From
      there I will gain the experience to move to management and become
      a CTO or CIO.</p>
    <h2> About Myself </h2>
    <p>After graduating high school, I went to college at UNLV for a
      Pre-Professional Biology degree. However, after 5 years and
      deciding to double-major in Biology and Physics, I needed a
      change. Spending 17 years in school and looking at even more for
      Medical School left me feeling like I was missing out on life.</p>
    <p>After graduation at UNLV, I decided to enlist in the US Army as
      an Infantryman. While some people frown upon this job choice, I
      felt it allowed me to become a "jack of all trades." In an
      Infantry Company everyone must be able to do anyone else's job
      including administrative duties, and there is a lot of
      cross-training. I got to do some very cool things (jump out of
      airplanes) and attend some very cool schools (Special Forces
      Assessment and Selection, Special Operations Combat Medic Course,
      Machine Gun Leaders Course, etc). After being injured during
      nighttime airborne operations, I was assigned as the Company
      Armorer while awaiting a medical discharge. I was in charge of
      over $6M in cutting edge military equipment. On January 1st, 2015,
      I received my Honorable Discharge, and moved on to the next
      chapter in my life.</p>
    <p>While awaiting my discharge, my girlfriend and I had the greatest
      blessing in my life and learned that she was pregnant. We got
      married shortly after, and on March 20th, 2015 she gave birth to a
      beautiful baby boy. With the goal of finding a career that I loved
      and providing for my family, I began pursuing a Computer Science
      degree back at UNLV. I soon found a position as a student worker
      in the Department of Computer Science, with a boss that has an
      unbelievable wealth of information. And this is where I am now.</p>
