<h2> Career Objective </h2>
<p>I am a Computer Science student at University of Nevada, Las Vegas expecting to graduate in Spring 2018.  I am 
also currently working as a Junior System Administrator in UNLV's Department of
Computer Science.  My goal is to get into DevOps or Software
Engineering.  From there I will gain the experience to move to management and
become a CTO or CIO.</p>
<h2> About Myself </h2>
<p>After graduating high school, I went to college at UNLV for a Pre-Professional Biology degree.  However, after 5 years and deciding to double-major in
Biology and Physics I decided that I needed a change.  Spending 17 years in
school and looking at even more for Medical School left me feeling like I was
missing out on life.</p>
<p>After graduation at UNLV, I decided to enlist in the US Army as an Infantryman.
While some people frown upon this job choice, I felt it allowed me to become a "jack
of all trades."  Almost every single role in a typical Infantry Company is filled by
Infantryman, and there is a lot of cross-training.  I got to do some very cool things
(jump out of airplanes) and attend some very cool schools (Special Forces Assessment
and Selection, Special Operations Combat Medic Course, Machine Gun Leaders Course, etc).  After being injured during nighttime airborne operations, I was assigned as the
Company Armorer while awaiting a medical discharge.  I was in charge of over $6M in
cutting edge military equipment.  On January 1st, 2015, I received my Honorable
Discharge, and moved on to the next chapter in my life.</p>
<p>While awaiting discharge, my girlfriend and I had the greatest blessing in my life
and learned that she was pregnant.  We got married shortly after, and on March 20th, 
2015 she gave birth to a beautiful baby boy.  With the goal of finding a career that
I loved and providing for my family, I began pursuing a Computer Science degree back
at UNLV.  I soon found a position as a student worker in the Department of Computer
Science, with a boss that has an unbelievable wealth of information.  And this is
where I am now.</p>
