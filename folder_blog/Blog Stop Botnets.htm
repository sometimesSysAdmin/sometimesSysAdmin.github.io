        Only you can prevent botnets!!&nbsp; Botnets have been the talk
        of the industry lately.&nbsp; DDOSing their way left and right,
        you have definitely heard of them by now.&nbsp; What are
        botnets, why are they important, and how can they be stopped?<br>
        <br>
        A botnet is a collection of *computers* that is connected to the
        internet, under the control of a person with malicious
        intentions.&nbsp; The reason there are so many of these zombie
        computers is due to the explosion of the internet of things
        (IoT).&nbsp; Manufacturers have identified a demand that more
        and more products be connected to the internet.&nbsp; The
        manufacturers asked how to connect their device to the internet
        and nobody stopped to ask the question of why it needed to be
        connected in the first place.&nbsp; So now we live in the age
        where your coffeemaker, fridge, microwave, TV, and many other
        devices are connected to the internet.&nbsp; Most of these
        connect through your router.&nbsp; Yes, YOUR router is what is
        allowing these devices to become part of botnets that cripple
        DNS servers and prevent us good internet users from watching cat
        videos on our favorite websites.&nbsp; <br>
