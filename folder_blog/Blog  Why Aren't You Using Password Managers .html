      <h2><u>Why Aren't You Using a Password Manager?</u></h2>
      <p><i>December 11, 2016<br>
          Jamie Harvey<br>

      <p align="left">Everyone knows that passwords are a pain to deal
        with.&nbsp; If it's a strong password then it's impossible to
        remember.&nbsp; And so many websites and systems require
        usernames and passwords.&nbsp; It's very tempting to reuse
        passwords across a multitude of sites.&nbsp; I know I've been
        tempted to.&nbsp; Who can remember 10 different randomly
        generated passwords, all of which must be changed every 3 or 6
        months?&nbsp; Now who thinks anyone using the environment they
        administer can do the same?<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">But what if one of these accounts gets
        breached?&nbsp; Most people tend to use the same or similar
        account names across a wide variety of services.&nbsp; And the
        same with passwords.&nbsp; So John Doe with e-mail <b>jdoe@example.com</b>
        uses the password <b>johnpasswd</b> for his email, Facebook,
        Google, Yahoo, banking website, and corporate Active Directory
        account.&nbsp; Then he writes it down on a sticky note and
        leaves it on his computer monitor for all to see.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">So the attacker gains access to John Doe's
        Facebook account.&nbsp; He gets John's email address from
        Facebook and logs on to his email account.&nbsp; John saved an
        email with instructions to access a VPN to his work's
        network.&nbsp; What a surprise, his password is still <b>johnpasswd</b>
        and Mr. Hacker is sitting inside your network.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Enter the password manager.&nbsp; A password
        manager is an application that creates and stores all of your
        usernames and passwords and hides them behind a master
        password.&nbsp; The good ones will have applications for mobile
        and desktop systems that sync with each other.&nbsp; I use
        1Password.&nbsp; It syncs encrypted keychains over Dropbox to
        backup my passwords.&nbsp; My favorite feature for the Android
        mobile app is fingerprint authentication.&nbsp; After
        authenticating inside the app, it has my saved logins with a
        title, username, password, url, and a note for a
        description.&nbsp; When creating a new login, you can generate a
        password with letters, digits, and symbols with lengths from 4
        to 50 characters.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">With this app I have a different password for each
        computer system, network, web service.&nbsp; This, with the help
        of 2 factor authentication (when available), will not only help
        prevent your accounts being hacked, but if one does get
        compromised it will be much harder (but not impossible) to lose
        any other accounts.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Have you educated your users on password
        management?&nbsp; It's easy to forget that our environments
        contain many people who lack the computer skills we have in our
        industry.&nbsp; No matter how hardened your environment may be,
        your users are an attack vector that can help or hurt your
        overall security.<br>
