      <div align="left">We live in a Golden Age of storage.&nbsp; It has
        never been easier or cheaper to store large amounts of
        data.&nbsp; This article focuses on USB Flash Drives, and why
        you probably don't have enough of them.<br>
        <br>
        I recently overheard a conversation that went a little like
        this.&nbsp; <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Person A: </i>I need to save these files
        but they're too big to e-mail to myself.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Person B: </i>Can you save them to
        DropBox or Google Drive?<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Person A: </i>I don't want to make an
        account/I can't remember my password.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Person B:</i> Well can't you just make a
        new account?<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Person A: </i>I tried and it says an
        account is already registered to my e-mail.&nbsp; Isn't there an
        easier way?<br>
        <br>
        At this point in the conversation, I had to interject.&nbsp;
        There was an easier way.&nbsp; In fact there were multiple
        easier ways, and I'll be focusing on two of them.<br>
        <br>
        At the time of this posting, there are at least ten different 32
        GB flash drives that can be had for under $10.&nbsp; Any one of
        these flash drives is smaller than one of your fingers, and
        holds an amount of data that just 20 years ago would have
        required a server the size of an entire room.&nbsp; They can be
        attached to your keychain, put in a briefcase, or even stuck in
        that one tiny pocket of your jeans that isn't big enough for
        anything else.&nbsp; Each of these flash drives has an option
        for encryption, so even if you lose possession of it your data
        isn't flowing freely.&nbsp; It's almost 2017, and at this point
        there is absolutely no reason you shouldn't have a small flash
        drive to save your data and move it around.<br>
        <br>
        "But wait," you're saying.&nbsp; "You said there were 2 easier
        ways."&nbsp; You are absolutely correct reader!&nbsp; If for
        some reason you didn't want to plop down a crisp Hamilton for a
        USB flash drive, there's still a pretty good chance that you're
        walking around with storage in your pocket.&nbsp; If you own a
        smartphone (and if you don't then honestly it's kind of weird
        that you're reading my blog) then you have storage!&nbsp; If you
        have an Android device, plug it into whatever computer holds
        your data that you want, and from the phone menu choose the MTP
        file transfer protocol.&nbsp; Then inside of the computers file
        explorer you will see your phone's file system.&nbsp; Feel free
        to drag and drop to your heart's content.<br>
        <br>
        If you have an iPhone, the procedure is a bit more
        complicated.&nbsp; Connect your iPhone to your computer and open
        iTunes.&nbsp; Select your phone and click Apps -&gt; File
        Sharing -&gt; Flash Drive.&nbsp; Then you can click on "Add
        Files..." and add the files you want to your iPhone.&nbsp; Then,
        next time you get a chance, ditch the iPhone and buy an Android.<br>
        <br>
        So if you have no idea what to ask Santa for, you can never go
        wrong with a <a target="_blank"
