      <h2><u>Signal Messaging<br>
        </u></h2>
      <p><i>December 21, 2016<br>

      <div align="left">While listening to the Security Now podcast, I
        learned of Signal.&nbsp; Similar to WhatsApp, this messaging
        service supports encrypted messaging.&nbsp; But unlike WhatsApp,
        Signal takes their encryption to the next level.&nbsp; This post
        explores the necessity of encryption and why you should start
        using Signal YESTERDAY!<br>
        <br>
        With the wave of terrorist attacks still fresh in everyone's
        minds, the authorities have a great deal of investigating ahead
        of them.&nbsp; As seen in the San Bernadino attack, much of this
        investigating involves searching the (alleged) attacker's
        messages.&nbsp; Indeed, a large portion of media coverage
        involved a recovered iPhone that belonged to the attacker.&nbsp;
        The FBI attempted to force Apple to unlock this phone, with
        Apple denying that it had this capability.&nbsp; Of course, it
        is the duty of the authorities to explore and investigate every
        piece of information available to them.&nbsp; While Apple
        avoided its hand being forced (a 3rd party was able to unlock
        it) the precedent that could be set has huge implications on the
        few privacies Americans have left.&nbsp; Many believe the
        government should have the ability to decrypt these messages,
        and I'm here to tell you why that's not the case.<br>
        <br>
        The Founding Fathers could never have imagined the invention of
        computers, much less how heavily every day life relies on
        them.&nbsp; If you tell me you can make it through everyday life
        without the use of a single computer, I will happily call you a
        liar and question how you're reading this blog post.&nbsp; But
        one thing the Founding Fathers did imagine is that the
        government would take every chance it could to infringe on the
        rights of the people.&nbsp; They knew because they lived
        it.&nbsp; <br>
