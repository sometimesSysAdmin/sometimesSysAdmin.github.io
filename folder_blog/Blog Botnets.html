        Only you can prevent botnets!!&nbsp; Botnets have been the talk
        of the industry lately.&nbsp; DDOSing their way left and right,
        you have definitely heard of them by now.&nbsp; What are
        botnets, why are they important, and how can they be stopped?<br>
        <br>
        A botnet is a collection of *computers* that is connected to the
        internet, under the control of a person with malicious
        intentions.&nbsp; The reason there are so many of these zombie
        computers is due to the explosion of the internet of things
        (IoT).&nbsp; Manufacturers have identified a demand that more
        and more products be connected to the internet.&nbsp; The
        manufacturers asked how to connect their device to the internet
        and nobody stopped to ask the question of why it needed to be
        connected in the first place.&nbsp; So now we live in the age
        where your coffeemaker, fridge, microwave, TV, and many other
        devices are connected to the internet.<br>
        <br>
        These devices rarely, if ever, receive security updates.&nbsp;
        Sometimes they are created without any security concerns in the
        first place.&nbsp; And other times, the software was created
        with malicious software to begin with!!&nbsp; A number of new
        IoT devices are made quickly and cheap straight from
        China.&nbsp; When I was in the military I became wary of
        equipment made by the lowest bidder (and that was lowest in the
        US).&nbsp; Do we really want to trust things running on our
        network made by 8 cent per hour labor?&nbsp; So the software
        running on your microwave gets compromised and joins an army of
        other compromised devices.&nbsp; Then like an orchestra, the
        conductor begins and every device starts sending traffic to the
        targeted webservers.&nbsp; This is what is known as a DDOS
        attack.&nbsp; The webserver(s) become flooded with requests and
        packets.&nbsp; It's like trying to drink water through a
        firehose with packets dropping left and right.<br>
        <br>
        Most of these devices in your home connect through your
        router.&nbsp; Yes, YOUR router is what is allowing these devices
        to become part of botnets that cripple DNS servers and prevent
        us good internet users from watching cat videos on our favorite
        websites.&nbsp; As consumer connectivity and bandwidth improves,
        these attacks grow stronger and stronger.&nbsp; The onerous
        falls on the consumer, as most ISPs tend to pass the buck.&nbsp;
        Luckily, consumer grade routers have become pretty advanced.<br>
        <br>
        Chances are you either have a firewall or a router that allows
        you to create firewall rules.&nbsp; The most secure option is of
        course not connecting these devices to a network.&nbsp; My
        parents recently got a smart TV that could connect to a network
        for some simple applications.&nbsp; None of these applications
        would ever be used, so I asked them if they really wanted their
        new TV connected to the network.&nbsp; They of course wanted it
        connected anyways.&nbsp; So the next more secure option was to
        add the device, but create firewall rules to block all traffic
        to and from the device.&nbsp; It showed up as connected,
        wouldn't become a botnet, and they were none the wiser.&nbsp;
        Sometimes, blocking all traffic will break a service on the
        device.&nbsp; Whether this service is critical or not is your
        call, and you'll need to use your networking skills to deduce
        what port/services are required for the service to work (hint:
        if the time stops working allow ntp).&nbsp; Open up these
        ports/services and nothing more!<br>
        <br>
        The next time a DDOS attack leaves your favorite website
        unreachable, make sure that you aren't part of the problem.<br>
